# cancerpred
## Prediction of small molecules as potent inhibitors of various cancer targets using Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Description

It is a framework centered around Python, specializing in machine learning and deep learning for the field of drug discovery. Equipped with an array of features, it streamlines various drug discovery and chemoinformatics challenges. Its foundation incorporates **Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PaDEL** etc. facilitating the creation of personalized machine learning and deep learning models or the utilization of existing ones. Furthermore, it leverages the **RDKit** framework to calculate ADMET properties.

#### *Data Collection from ChEMBL*

The [ChEMBL Database] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) compiles curated bioactivity information on over 2 million compounds sourced from in excess of 88,000 documents and 1.6 million assays. This comprehensive dataset encompasses details across 15,000 targets, 2000 cells, and 45,000 indications. The data provided is current as of January 02, 2024, under ChEMBL version 33. We need to install "chembl_webresource_client" library before we can download the data from ChEMBL33 database.
